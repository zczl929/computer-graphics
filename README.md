This repository contains coursework from the UCL Computer Graphics module, including ray tracing, rasterization, and path tracing using OpenGL.

- Ray-tracing: defining geometry, computing ray intersections, casting shadows, reflections, refractions, and Fresnel.
- Rasterization: Projection, clipping, rasterization, interpolation, z-buffering, texturing, and anti-aliasing.
- Path tracing: bouncing lights, physically-correct Phong, Halton sampling, anti-aliasing, importance sampling, and motion blurs.

Note: Source code is not shared to comply with academic policies.
